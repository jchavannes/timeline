        <p>
            The purpose for this timeline was to get a better perspective on the steps in the evolution of the universe leading to modern civilization.
            The path leading to us is a series of incremental changes, but there are some milestones that stick out - the Big Bang, Earth, Life, Animals, and Human Civilization.
            Other than the Big Bang, each of these was a gradual transition.
            We currently seem to be in the middle of another transition - probably one of the top five ever known - the development of computers, and likely artificial intelligence.

            Understanding our past might be one of the best ways to predict where we will go in the future.
            Nothing is certain, the history of Earth is full of mass extinction events, that took millions of years to recover from.
            Hopefully humanity doesn't succumb to one of the many threats, like nuclear war, manufactured super viruses, destruction of our climate, or even terminator AI.
            It's unknown what AI would do to humanity, but it's amazing to appreciate, in the 13.82 billion year history of the known universe, how critical a point in time we were born into.
